  "description": "Bot generates random words from Wordnik API, strings three of them together in various combinations and compares these three-word combinations against a geo-mapping API called what3words. What3words has the entire globe mapped out in 3mx3m squares, tagged as strings of text in this format: (word1.word2.word3). The coordinates associated with the location defined by (word1.word2.word3) are fed into google static maps and an image from google static maps is tweeted of those coordinates.",
